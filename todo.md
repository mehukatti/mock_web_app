1. Shopping cart funtionality
    * Shopping cart memory
    * Confirmation that item was added to shopping cart
    * Shopping cart html
        * Adding and removing products
    * Send order button
    * Shopping cart short cut to nav bar
2. Order sheet
    * Alert that nothing really is saved nor is your info actually saved.
    * Contact info
    * Fake payment button that opens pop up that displays something about mock payment. Maybe add image of monopoly money or similar kid money. Clicking ok in the pop up acts as if payment was successfully made.
    * Confirmation
    * Pop up that successfully made accompanied by an alert that nothing happens because this whole app is fake.
3. For shits and giggles.
    * How about a free can of coctail fruits when all products are added into the shopping cart?
